By Darren Soh
# Current Tech Stacks:

Golang, Gin Framework, React, MongoDB, GraphQL, Typescript, Redis, Docker, Docker compose,

# Findings:
Important for go gin to rebuild by rebooting,
Need to Echo path everytime we run swag init to refresh changes made in Swagger
Primitive bson is superior because it gives a hard to decrypt string as key.

# DevOps:

Gin Framework, ReactJS, MongoDB, GraphQL

## Bash Scripting for development:
